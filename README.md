# üéì Student Data Management Web App

## üìå Project Overview
This is a **serverless web application** designed to store, manage, and retrieve student data efficiently.  
The application is hosted on **AWS** and utilizes various AWS services for backend operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: AWS Lambda (Python)  
- **Database**: AWS DynamoDB  
- **Storage**: AWS S3  
- **API Management**: AWS API Gateway  
- **Hosting**: AWS S3 (Static Website Hosting)  

## üöÄ Features
‚úîÔ∏è Add new student records (**Name, ID, Department, Email, etc.**)  
‚úîÔ∏è Retrieve student details based on **Student ID**  
‚úîÔ∏è Update student information  
‚úîÔ∏è Delete student records  
‚úîÔ∏è **Serverless architecture** for cost efficiency  
‚úîÔ∏è **Secure API communication** using AWS API Gateway

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Architecture
```plaintext
[Frontend (HTML, CSS, JS)] ---> [API Gateway] ---> [AWS Lambda (Python)] ---> [DynamoDB]
S3: Hosts the frontend static files.
API Gateway: Manages API requests.
AWS Lambda: Backend logic for CRUD operations.
DynamoDB: Stores student records.

üñ•Ô∏è Setup & Deployment

üîπ Prerequisites
AWS Account
Python (for AWS Lambda functions)
AWS CLI installed and configured
Node.js (if using additional tools like AWS SDK)

üîπ Steps to Deploy

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:

2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload frontend files to AWS S3:
Navigate to AWS S3 ‚Üí Create a new bucket ‚Üí Enable static website hosting.
Upload index.html, styles.css, and script.js.
Copy the S3 URL to access your frontend.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create DynamoDB Table:
Go to AWS DynamoDB ‚Üí Create a table named Students.
Set StudentID as the Primary Key.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy AWS Lambda functions:
Set the correct IAM role for DynamoDB access.
Want to create seperate Lambda function for each API methods

5Ô∏è‚É£ Set up API Gateway:
Create a new API in API Gateway.
Define methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and link them to the respective Lambda functions.
Enable CORS for frontend interaction.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Test the application:
Open the S3 URL in your browser.
Perform CRUD operations on student data

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
CORS Errors?	Ensure CORS is enabled in API Gateway.
Permission Issues?	Check IAM roles for Lambda & DynamoDB.
S3 Website Not Loading?	Enable public access for S3 files.
